      <p class="second-sec-subtag small-font">Computer is an electronic machine that takes an input, processes it
        to producethe desired output. Every computer is a combination of hardware and software.The physical
        components of a computer that can be seen and touched form thehardware. For example, CPU, monitor,
        keyboard, printer etc., are hardware orperipheral devices. The input to a computer is given in the form
        of instructions.These set of instructions that we give to the computer to perform a particular
        taskconstitutes a program. Many such programs together form a software for thecomputer. Operating
        system, Antivirus, MS Office, Computer games are allsoftware applications.Computer is an advanced
        electronic device that takes raw data as an input from the user and processes it under the control of a
        set of instructions (called program), produces a result (output), and saves it for future use.

      <p class="second-sec-tag big-font">Bug Bounty Hunting</p>
      <p class="second-sec-subtag small-font"> A bug bounty is a monetary reward offered to white hat hackers for successfully pinpointing a security bug that causes a vulnerability.
          A vulnerability is a “weak spot” that enables black hat hackers, criminals who break into networks with malicious intent, to gain unauthorized access to a website, tool,
           or system. More often than not, a security vulnerability can have catastrophic implications for an organization. Bug bounty programs can vary greatly from firm to firm. However, a few parameters remain constant. 

           Prior to launching a bounty, a company sets the scope and budget of the program. A scope defines which systems, tools, or software a hacker may test.
           
           When a flaw within the specified scope is found, a hacker creates a disclosure report that contains a breakdown of the risk using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), a description of the flaw, and its possible impact. Furthermore, the report includes security advice and fixes for the flaw.
           
           Any vulnerability discovered in violation of set rules is not eligible for a bounty. Organizations can also choose to host a private bug bounty. Unlike public bounty programs, a private program is open to a select group of ethical hackers.</p>

      <p class="second-sec-tag big-font">Cyber Security</p>
      <p class="second-sec-subtag small-font">Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and
        sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security,
        cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications,
        whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization.



        Security system complexity, created by disparate technologies and a lack of in-house expertise, can
        amplify these costs. But organizations with a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, governed by best
        practices and automated using advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, can
        fight cyberthreats more effectively and reduce the lifecycle and impact of breaches when they occur.</p>

      <p class="second-sec-tag big-font">Ethical Hacking</p>
      <p class="second-sec-subtag small-font">Ethical hacking is also known as White hat Hacking or Penetration
        Testing. Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system
        or data. Ethical hacking is used to improve the security of the systems and networks by fixing the
        vulnerability found while testing.

        Ethical hackers improve the security posture of an organization. Ethical hackers use the same tools,
        tricks, and techniques that malicious hackers used, but with the permission of the authorized person.
        The purpose of ethical hacking is to improve the security and to defend the systems from attacks by
        malicious users.</p>
